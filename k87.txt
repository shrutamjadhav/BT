
Title: Write a program in solidity to create Student data. Use the following constructs:
 Structures
 Arrays
 Fallback
Deploy this as smart contract on Ethereum and Observe the transaction fee and Gas value.
Objective: Understand and explore the working of Blockchain technology and its applications.
Course Outcome:
CO6:Interpret the basic concepts in Blockchain technology and its application.
Description:
Step 1: Open Remix IDE on any of your browsers, select on the New File and click on Solidity to 
choose the environment.
Step 2: Write the Student Management code in the code section, and click the Compile
button under the Compiler window to compile the contract.
Step 3: To execute the code, click on the Deploy button under Deploy and Run Transactions 
window. After deploying the code click on the drop-down on the console.
Code
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6;
contract Student_management
{
struct Student {
int stud_id;
 string name;
 string department;
 }
 Student[] Students;
 function add_stud(int stud_id,string memory name, string memory department) public{
    
    Student memory stud = Student(stud_id,name,department);
    Students.push(stud);
 }

function getStudent(int stud_id) public view returns(string memory, string memory){
    for (uint i=0;i<Students.length;i++)
    {
        Student memory stud = Students[i];
        if(stud.stud_id==stud_id){
        return(stud.name,stud.department);
    }
    }
    return("Not Found", "Not Found");
    }
}
Sample Output 
After deploying the contact successful you can observe two button add_stud and 
getStudents.Give the input stud_id, name dept and click on getStudents button, enter the stud_id 
which you have given as an Input and get the information of Students name and department 
Refer the following output
Conclusion: Hence,wehave studieda program in solidity to create Student data
