Title: Write a survey report on types of Blockchains and its real time use cases.
Objective: Understand and the types of Blockchain technology and its real time applications.
Course Outcome:
CO6:Interpret the basic concepts in Blockchain technology and its application.
Description:
A blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as 
"completed" blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a 
cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin nodes use 
the block chain to differentiate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins 
that have already been spent elsewhere. 
Types of Blockchain 
There are three types of blockchains- public, private and consortium. 
1. Public Blockchain: A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone 
with an internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e. 
participate in the consensus process). Bitcoin is the best example of a public blockchain. 
2. Private Blockchain: A private blockchain is a little more centralized. Here, a central 
authority controls who can access the network and who can become a validator. 
Validators on a private blockchain are typically vetted by the central authority. 
Permissioned blockchains are often used in enterprise settings where centralized control 
is necessary. An example of a private blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric. 
3. Consortium Blockchain: A consortium blockchain is a hybrid of the public and private 
blockchain. Here, a group of companies or organizations control who can access the 
network and who can become a validator. The selection of validators is typically done 
through a voting process. Consortium blockchains are often used in cases where multiple 
parties need to collaborate but no party is fully trusted. An example of a consortium 
blockchain is the R3 Corda platform. 
Real-Time Use Cases of Blockchain
1. Supply Chain Management Blockchain can be used to create an immutable record of all 
the transactions in a supply chain. This can help to increase transparency and traceability 
in the supply chain. 
2. Identity Management Blockchain can be used to create a digital identity for individuals, 
organizations, and devices. This can be used for KYC (know your customer) and AML 
(anti-money laundering) compliance. 
3. Payments Blockchain can be used to process payments. This can be done using 
cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. 
4. Data Management Blockchain can be used to store data in a tamper-proof and 
decentralized manner. This can be used for data sharing and data security. 
5. IoT Blockchain can be used to create a decentralized network of IoT devices. This can be
used for data sharing and data security. 
6. Predictive Analytics Blockchain can be used to create a decentralized network of 
predictive analytics models. This can be used for data sharing and data security.
Conclusion: Hence,wehave studiedto write a survey report on types of Blockchains and its real 
time use cases
